# Gas-leakage-detection-with-buzzer-alert-
The Gas Leakage Detection with Buzzer Alert project is designed to detect harmful gas leaks using an MQ-series gas sensor. When the gas concentration exceeds a safe level, the system triggers a buzzer and LED to warn users. It can also send alerts to prevent fire accidents and ensure home safety.
